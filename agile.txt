Tyler Taormina Agile Questions

1st session
===============================================================================
1. In the next half hour I will begin constructing an outline for the entire
project.

2. I know that we will need to have six functinos for the user to choose from.
I know that we will need a way to gather input from the user, process the input
data. In all, I would expect to use 7-9 functions.

3. I don't know where I will need assignments by reference or by value. I also
don't know how I am going to manipulate the integer to acheive the desired
functionality of the program.


2nd session
===============================================================================
1.In the next half hour I will start by writing functions for displaying the
menu and allowing the user to choose from the menu. I will also start to work
on a function that will process the user input and use that data to call the
desired function.

2. I know that I will need to read an input from the user. I also know that in
the processing function I will need to use a switch statement.

3. I don't know how I will allow the user to choose to end the program.



3rd session
===============================================================================
1. In the next half hour I will begin writing the multiplication and addition
tables.

2. I know the layout and the range that are desired for the multiplication
tables. I also know that I will most likely need to use nested for loops for
this function.

3. I don't know exactly how the indexing will work inside of the nested for
loops.
